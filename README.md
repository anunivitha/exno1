Data Cleaning Process

# AIM
To read the given data and perform data cleaning and save the cleaned data to a file.

# Explanation
Data cleaning is the process of preparing data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect ,incompleted , irrelevant , duplicated or improperly formatted. Data cleaning is not simply about erasing data ,but rather finding a way to maximize datasets accuracy without necessarily deleting the information.

# Algorithm
STEP 1: Read the given Data

STEP 2: Get the information about the data

STEP 3: Remove the null values from the data

STEP 4: Save the Clean data to the file

STEP 5: Remove outliers using IQR

STEP 6: Use zscore of to remove outliers

# Result
Thus we have cleaned the data and removed the outliers by detection using IQR and Z-score method.
